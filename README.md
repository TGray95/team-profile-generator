  ## Description

  This is a node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
  ## Installation

  Use the command line to navigate to the application directory, then use 'npm i' to install required packages.
  ## Usage

  To initiate the application, enter 'npm start' in the command line while in the application directory. You will be prompted to enter information on the team manager. After answering the prompts, you will be given the option to either add additional team members or end the application and generate the team html document. Once all team members are added, select 'finish team', and your team html will be generated in the 'dist' directory. 'npm run reset' may be used to empty the 'dist' directory of any previously generated html file.
